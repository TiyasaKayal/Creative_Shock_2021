This presentation outlines a strategic approach to expanding the reach and impact of Eskedar Coffee through a series of well-thought-out initiatives. The slides emphasize Eskedar Coffee's mission to elevate its brand while indirectly supporting refugees by promoting a better lifestyle. The presentation suggests leveraging the founder's personal journey, podcasting, blogs, and short films to engage a wider audience. Overcoming language barriers through multilingual content and capitalizing on Lithuania's passion for basketball are also key strategies. Factory tours for students, customer incentive programs, and participating in World Refugee Day activities further enrich the marketing plan. The presentation also highlights the power of public transportation advertising and word-of-mouth marketing in a compact setting like Lithuania.
